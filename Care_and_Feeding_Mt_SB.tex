\section{Introduction}
Mt. Stony Brook Observatory is the Stony Brook University Astronomy Department's facility for astronomy research and pubic outreach.
Located on the roof of the Earth and Space Sciences Building in the center of West Campus, the Observatory is home to a Meade 14" Cassegrain telescope, Celestron 8" Cassegrain telescopes, a Coronado solar refractor, several large-format CCD cameras, spectrographs, and many accessories.
This document is intended to serve as a manual supplementary to the official manuals for each instrument, which can be found at \url{https://sites.google.com/site/stonybrookastronomyclub/mt-stony-brook-observatory}.
It primarily contains instructions specific to the setup of these instruments at Mt. Stony Brook and the maintenance and care for these instruments not otherwise covered by their respective manuals.
It is also intended to be an update to the manual by Wahl and Metchev, 2013 \cite{wahl13} and the much earlier work by Adams, Petreshock, and Wolk, 1995\cite{adams95}.
This manual should be updated when the Astronomy Club or Astronomy Department acquires a new piece of equipment or software or when an older piece of equipment or software becomes deprecated or inoperable.

The site of the Observatory is one of the most light-polluted areas on Eastern Long Island. The absence of directional lighting on campus results in a naked-eye limiting magnitude of 5-5.5. Stony Brook has recently transitioned the majority of outdoor lights on campus to LED, whose broad-spectrum emission may pose a problem when attempting to do spectroscopy. However, the largest light pollution problem is posed by the LeValle Stadium lights; metal-halide lamps which point directly at the Observatory and wash out much of the northern sky. It is recommended that observations of dim targets in the northern hemisphere of the sky be planned around the stadium schedule.


\section{Meade LX200 14'' Telescope}
Mt. Stony Brook's primary telescope is a 14'' f/10 Meade LX200GPS, Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (affectionately known as "Betsy") that is permanently mounted in the Ash Dome on top of ESS.
It is operated via the Autostar II hand controller, which can issue slew commands and contains a catalog of objects.
The telescope is equipped with a 8x50 finder scope which has a 50mm objective and 8x magnification.
The telescope was installed in 2010 and has accumulated wear and tear.
The gears in the drive motor are worn and will occasionally slip, causing the physical pointing to disagree with the pointing in the Autostar.
The knob to lock the primary mirror is known to come off and is difficult to reattach so it is best to leave the mirror unlocked. When the telescope was assembled, the declination (DEC) setting circle stickers were were placed on the wrong sides. Since the setting circle with the angles labeled can be adjusted independent of the telescope, the angles do not refer to a meaningful DEC.
All directions in this section are given relative to the user looking at the telescope control panel, facing south.
It is recommended that you prop both dome doors open while observing with the LX200 to maintain stable airflow around the telescope, which will improve seeing.
\par There are two default positions that are programmed into the LX200, shown below.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
        \centering

        \caption{Park position}
    \end{subfigure}%
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

        \caption{Polar home}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Default positions}
\end{figure}
\noindent When in park position, the telescope is at RA 0h0m0s, DEC 0$\deg$0'0'', pointing due South with the telescope tube parallel to the mount.
This is the position that the telescope should return to when it is parked, before shutting down.
If it does not return to this position, the pointing is likely incorrect.
The polar home position is used during pointing correction, with the telescope at RA 0h0m0s, DEC 90$\deg$0'0'' and the finder scope underneath the telescope tube.

\subsection{Quick Setup Guide (Eyepiece Observing)} \label{ssec:betsy_quick}
The RA and DEC locks on the telescope tube must remain in the LOCKED position at all times. The telescope should be slewed using the Autostar II hand controller.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Turn on dome drive power (red switch, north side of dome). \label{enum:quicksetup_start}
	\item Open the dome upper shutter by pressing \underline{START}, followed by UPPER SHUTTER OPEN on the dome hand controller (All dome remote commands must be preceded by \underline{START}). If the dome ever loses power and needs to be open or shut manually, refer to Sec. \ref{ssec:dome_trouble}.
\footnote[$\dagger$]{\textbf{Do not open the dome if it is raining, snowing, high winds, or if there is snow accumulation on top of the dome.}}
	\item Open the dome lower shutter by pressing LOWER SHUTTER OPEN on the hand controller
	\item Remove the canvas cover from the telescope.
	\item Gently remove the dust covers from the front of the telescope and finder scope.
	\item Insert 2'' star diagonal and 1.25'' adapter into optical tube. Tighten thumbscrews.
	\item Plug the telescope power cable into the base of the pillar. Turn on the telescope mount (power switch on the RA gearbox).
	\item Wait for telescope to take a GPS fix. For troubleshooting see Sec. \ref{sssec:autostar_trouble}
	\item Insert eyepiece into star diagonal. Tighten thumbscrews.
	\item Ensure primary mirror lock is not engaged (leave the mirror unlocked, the knob has a tendency to fall off).
	\item Slew telescope to a bright object and adjust coarse manual focus knob to bring the object into focus. Fine adjustment can be made with the microfocuser via the Autostar II hand controller.\\[2em]
	\label{enum:quicksetup_end}
	\textbf{\begin{center}
	Shutdown Procedure:
	\end{center}}
	\item \textbf{Park the telescope.\footnote[*]{DONT FORGET TO PARK THE TELESCOPE!!!}} Failure to do so will result in incorrect pointing the next time it is powered up. From the Autostar II hand controller:\\
Select Item:
	\item[]\quad $>$Utilities
	\item[]\quad\quad $>$Park Scope
	\label{enum:quickshutdown_start}
	\item Power off telescope
	\item Remove eyepiece from star diagonal
	\item Remove star diagonal from telescope tube
	\item Replace the dust covers on the front of the telescope and finder tube
	\item Replace canvas cover over telescope
	\item Rotate the dome so that the slit is over the south entrance door
	\item Close the dome lower shutter
	\item Close the dome upper shutter
	\item Write an observing log book entry with the observer's names, date/time in, date/time out, what you observed, any issues
	\item Turn off dome drive power
	\label{enum:quickshutdown_end}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Autostar II Hand Controller}
The Autostar II is the primary control interface for the operation of the LX200.
The data is not stored in the Autostar, but in the base of the telescope.
The current firmware version is V4.2g.
The buttons on the Autostar and their functions are identified below.

\end{tabular}}\\
\captionof{table}{Autostar II slew speeds}
				\label{tab:slew_speeds} 
\vspace{.4 cm}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Computer Connection}
The Autostar is programmable, to a certain degree, using the Meade Autostar software suite, which includes ASU (Autostar Updater) and AutoStar Observatory. 
This software is installed on the Department laptop.
From ASU, the Autostar firmware can be update, custom user objects managed, and custom tours added.
From AutoStar Observatory, the telescope can be slewed via computer serial control.
\par The cable to connect the laptop to the telescope is a USB-to-RS232-to-6-pin cable.
There is a spare on the top shelf with the eyepieces in the telescope room.
Plug the USB end of the cable into the laptop and the 6-pin end into the RS232 jack on the telescope's computer control panel.
Ensure that the Autostar is plugged into the HBX jack.

    \end{scope}
    
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Managing Custom User Objects}
The current version of Autostar Software includes over 145,000 objects in its database.
However, some dimmer objects are not included and you may want to add them to the database if their RA and DEC are known.
There are two methods for managing custom user objects, the first of which uses the hand controller directly:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] Select item:
	\item[]\quad $>$Object
	\item[]\quad\quad $>$User Object
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Select
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Add
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Delete
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Edit
\end{enumerate}
To add an object:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Add
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Enter object name using the menu navigation and number keys.
	To move between characters, use the slew-left and slew-right keys. Press ENTER.
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Enter object RA in the same fashion. Press ENTER. 
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Enter object DEC in the same fashion. Press ENTER.
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Optional: Enter the object's angular size in 
	min. Press ENTER.
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Optional: Enter the object's magnitude. Press ENTER.
\end{enumerate}
To slew to a User Object:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad $>$Select
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$Select the desired object and press ENTER.
	\item[]\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$The object name and its coordinates will appear. Press GOTO.
\end{enumerate}
If there are many User Objects stored in the Autostar, many of which are not in use or do not have meaningful names, the method using the ASU suite is desired:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Launch ASU from the laptop
	\item Connect the RS232 end of the computer interface cable into the corresponding jack on telescope's computer control panel and the USB end into the laptop.
	\item In ASU, click "Connect". "Model: LX200 GPS\quad Handbox Ver:4.2g" should appear at the bottom of the window.
	\item Click "Retrieve".
	\item All User Objects will be listed in the AutoStar panel under the User Objects tab.
	\item To Add, Edit, or Delete a User Object, right-click on the object, select the desired option, and fill in the objects information.
	\item Once all changes have been made, click "Send". Note: This will replace the AutoStar hand controller library with the ASU library.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Custom Tours}
Autostar tours enable the user to slew to multiple pre-determined objects in sequence without having to search through the Autostar's database.
Tours are ideal for Open Nights and other outreach events where the target objects are planned in advance.
They also allow the user to display custom information on the Autostar LCD while the tour is running,
Tours are written in .txt files and uploaded to the Autostar via the ASU software.
A guide to the tour syntax can be found in Appendix C of the LX200 Manual \cite{lx200}.
To upload a tour to the Autostar:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Launch ASU from the laptop
	\item File $>$ Import
	\item Select the .txt file containing your tour. Set object type to "Tour". Click "Import".
	\item The tour will appear in the left "Library" panel of ASU.
	\item Connect the laptop to the the telescope. Click "Connect" in ASU.
	\item Click "Retrieve". This will add the Autostar library to the ASU library.
	\item Select the tour you want to add and click "Selected -$>$".
			If a tour with the same name already exists on the Autostar, you will be prompted to replace it with the one in your library.
			The tour will appear in the "AutoStar" panel of ASU.
	\item Click "Send". Note: This will replace the AutoStar hand controller library with the ASU library.
\end{enumerate}
To run a tour on the telescope:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To initiate the tour on the Autostar press Select item $>$ Guided Tour.
	\item Navigate the list of tours and select the one you want to run by pressing ENTER.
	\item If an object has set or is not yet risen, the tour will automatically skip to the next object
	\item Press GOTO on an object to slew to it
	\item To exit the tour at any time press and hold MODE for 2 seconds.
\end{enumerate}
Sample tours can be found at \url{http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/astro/astroclub/Mt_Stony_Brook/AutostarII_Tours}.

\subsubsection{Autostar Troubleshooting}\label{sssec:autostar_trouble}
\textbf{\flushleft Issue:} The Autostar displays "TAKING GPS FIX" and nothing happens or displays "COULD NOT FIND GPS FIX"\\
\textbf{Solution:} Sometimes the telescope has difficulty taking a GPS fix if there is not a clear line-of-sight between the GPS antenna and the southern sky. Make sure the dome shutters are open. Rotate the dome so that the slit is pointing south and slew the telescope so that it is pointing westward. The fork arm with the antenna will be pointing south. 

\textbf{\flushleft Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The hand controller display gets dim or characters flicker or disappear.
	\item The hand controller is unresponsive to button presses
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Solution:} The Autostar display is an LCD which is known to dim in temperatures below 27$\deg$ F (-3 C) and fail altogether if exposed to such temperatures for more than 20 minutes, especially in high humidity. This is not permanent. Keep the hand controller inside your pocket while observing in especially cold conditions.

\textbf{\flushleft Issue:} The Autostar does not respond to slew commands during alignment\\
\textbf{Solution:} When performing an alignment, the Autostar will slew the telescope to a nearby bright star. Once the alignment star is reached, the Autostar allows the user to correct the pointing by centering the star in the eyepiece, but assumes that the telescope pointing is nearly correct. The Autostar automatically sets the slew rate to the lowest setting "2x" (0.5 arcmin/s). When issuing slew commands at this rate it may appear that the telescope is not responding when in fact it is moving very slowly.


\textbf{\flushleft Issues:} Telescope pointing for solar system objects is off by as much as 0.5\deg\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Since solar system objects are relatively close to Earth, their positions in the sky are known with less precision. This may seem counter-intuitive but closer objects have more complicated sidereal motion (relative to background stars). Small errors in telescope alignment are magnified when calculating positions of these objects. That is why you should avoid syncing the telescope on solar system objects.

\subsection{Changing the Filter Wheel}


\section{MallinCam Xtreme II}
The MallinCam Xtreme II is the Astronomy Club's color-video CCD camera.
The camera houses an extremely sensitive Sony X418AKL sensor and provides deep images with very short exposure times, especially when combined with a focal reducer.
This makes it an ideal tool for public outreach, allowing the operator to display images or video in "real time".
A major downside of the camera is that it outputs an analog video signal (which degrades with increasing cable length) so a conversion to HDMI is preferred if using a display monitor that is not mounted on the scope.
\textbf{Do not use power cable that is coupled with the composite video cable}.
Since the cables are not individually shielded, the power cable may induce a current in the video cable leading to rolling bars in the image.
The lack of a raw digital output also means that the scientific capabilities of the instrument are limited.
\par The camera contains a Peltier cooling system capable of cooling the sensor down to 26 C below ambient (unfortunately the camera does not give a temperature readout), greatly suppressing the thermal noise typical in such sensitive chips.
This also means that dew and frost have a tendency to condense on the sensor when operating at the highest cooling levels in high humidity conditions.
It is highly recommended that you read Section \ref{sssec:dew} on Dew and Frost Prevention before operating in such conditions.
\par The camera can be controlled by either the navigation keys on the back of the camera, a wireless Bluetooth remote, or by a computer running Miloslick MallinCam control software.
For detailed descriptions of the software menus and settings, refer to the Miloslick MallinCam control user's guide\cite{miloslick}.
Upon launching the software you may be prompted to update.
\textbf{Do not update MallinCam Miloslick software when prompted.}
Always click "Skip this version", otherwise you will have to purchase another activation key in order to continue using the updated software.
\par The MallinCam was purchased with an MFR-5 focal reducer, specifically designed for the MallinCam XII.
The focal reducer can provide between 0.3x and 0.8x reduction, depending on the configuration.
Refer to Appendix \ref{sssec:focal_reduction} for specifications of each configuration.
\par For a more detailed description of camera settings, components, and recommended settings refer to MallinCam's official Xtreme manual\cite{mallincam}. 
For any issues with the MallinCam including replacement parts, hardware failures, and general questions, contact Jack Huerkamp at MallinCamusa@gmail.com.

\subsection{Astrofest Setup\\
\small(MallinCam with Miloslick Control + Meade LX-200 + TV)}
This setup configuration is ideal for outreach events utilizing Meade LX-200 (and can also be extended to the C8s), where the MallinCam can be controlled from a laptop via the Miloslick control software and the camera images displayed on the TV.
This setup is also quite complicated and uses an absurd number of cables, so be wary of cable tangle and watch your step.
The true field of view with this setup is $\sim$17'.
The following items are required for this setup:

\subsection{Maintenance}
\subsubsection{Dust Removal} \label{sssec:dust}

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{./images/MallinCam/dust/mercury_transit.jpg} 
		\caption{A MallinCam image of the sun taken during a transit of Mercury.
		Out-of-focus dust "donuts" are visible throughout the entire image.}
		\label{sundust}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Unlike most CCD cameras, the MallinCam does not output raw pixel counts so artifacts due to the presence of dust on the sensor cannot be removed using standard preprocessing techniques.
Therefore, the only way to deal with the dust is to remove it from the front of the sensor.
The procedure described below can be applied to any eyepiece or objective.
A good rule of thumb for cleaning telescope optics is to do so \textit{only when absolutely necessary}.
Too-frequent cleaning can strip the coating on the lenses and dust accumulation can be prevented by keeping the optics covered when not in use.
Most of the materials required for this procedure can be found in the front pocket of the blue lunchbox where the camera is stored.
You will need:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
	\item Rubber bulb blower
	\item Magnifying glass
	\item 91\% or 99\% isopropyl alcohol (anything lower than 91\% will leave streaks)
	\item Microfiber cloth
	\item Small cotton swab\\
\end{enumerate}
The following procedure requires extreme care, a delicate touch, and a bit of guts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First try to blow the dust off with the rubber bulb blower
	\footnote[*]{\textbf{Never blow breath directly or use compressed air on telescope optics.}}
	\item If that doesn't work, wrap the microfiber cloth around the end of the cotton swab and dampen (don't soak) the cloth with alcohol.
		Try not to touch the cloth too much with your fingers.
	\label{enum:duststart}
	\item Very gently drag the tip of the cloth across the sensor in one direction.
	Apply almost no pressure at all, making several gentle passes in the same direction to clean the rest of the sensor.
	Avoid touching the pins around the edge of the sensor.
	\label{enum:dustend}
	\item After the sensor dries, inspect it with a magnifying glass under light at an angle.
	If it's still dusty, repeat steps \ref{enum:duststart} and \ref{enum:dustend} once.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Dew and Frost Prevention} \label{sssec:dew}

\begin{figure}[H]

				In the image of an out-of-focus star on the right, the condensation has turned to frost resulting in a 
				marbling pattern.}
\end{figure}


The MallinCam is equipped with a very efficient Peltier cooling system capable of cooling the CCD to 27$\deg$ F below ambient.
When moisture in the air is exposed to the chip at higher cooling levels, it will condense on the sensor.
At the highest cooling levels, the dew will freeze on the sensor.
Repeated frost buildup has the potential to damage the CCD.
The only way to prevent moisture from condensing on the sensor is to seal dry air inside the chamber around the CCD.
The following procedure is adapted from Woody Schlom's dew prevention guide.
We use the MFR-5 focal reducer to seal the chamber but, if no focal reduction is desired, another optically flat element can be used.
The procedure can be extended to dehumidify other instruments.
You will need:

\begin{longtable}[t]{cc}

\end{longtable}

If operating the camera at low cooling levels in high humidity without sealing the chamber, it helps to set the camera in the telescope before turning the cooling on.
If the telescope is closed-tube, this will provide some seal from the outside air.
Avoid pulling the camera in and out of the telescope unless necessary. 

Despite precautions, if you notice condensation forming, turn MOTION DETECT on by adjusting the following settings using the buttons on the back of the camera:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] \quad $>$Press Enter to open menu
	\item[] \quad\quad $>$ Scroll down to MOTION DETECT
	\item[] \quad\quad\quad $>$ Right arrow to toggle MOTION DETECT ON
	\item[] \quad\quad\quad\quad $>$ Press Enter to open MOTION DETECT menu
	\item[] \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$ Set LEVEL to full right and TIMER to 60 seconds
	\item[] \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad $>$ Return
\end{enumerate}
MOTION DETECT is the TEC (Thermal Electric Cooler) for the MallinCam. Setting it to the lowest level provides minimal cooling and allows the sensor to heat up and the condensation to evaporate. This can also be adjusted by the Peltier Cooler setting in Miloslick. Aggressive cooling should only be used when many hot pixels are present in images.


\subsection{MallinCam Troubleshooting}\label{ssec:x2troubleshoot}

\textbf{\flushleft Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Miloslick: "No MCXtreme X2/PC found on COM6"
	\item Miloslick: "Unknown serial port error"
	\item Miloslick: "No serial ports found"
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Solution:} Go to Windows Control Panel $>$ Devices and Printers. 
If "FT232R USB UART" is listed under "Unspecified", quit Miloslick (leaving camera control plugged in) and restart software.
The order that cables are plugged into the computer matter to the software.
If it's not listed, make sure the MallinCam power is on (red LED indicator).
If it is on, welp, you're on your own buddy.

\textbf{\flushleft Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Miloslick: "Video Device "USB OEM Device" Not Found"
	\item Miloslick: Blue screen in display window
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Solution:} Go to Windows Control Panel $>$ Devices and Printers.
If "USB OEM" is listed under "Unspecified", quit Miloslick (leaving camera control plugged in) and restart software.
If that doesn't work and you are using Miloslick for the first time on a new computer, the Frame Grabber device drivers will need to be installed via the Frame Grabber installation mini-disk in the front pocket of the blue lunchbox. If the device is still not listed, the frame grabber may be damaged.

\textbf{\flushleft Issue:} MallinCam is frozen or not responding to commands.\\
\textbf{Solution:} First, confirm the camera is in fact frozen by turning on the color bars in Miloslick and via the buttons on the back of the camera by pressing and holding the UP and DOWN buttons simultaneously for two seconds. If the color bars turn on via the camera buttons but not from Miloslick, the camera may no longer be connected to the software; refer to the first issue in this appendix. If the color bars do not turn on at all, turn off the MallinCam for 30 seconds, then power up as usual. If the issue is still not resolved, the MallinCam must be reset to its factory default settings by the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Press the CENTER button on the camera for two seconds until the menu appears
	\item Press the UP button once to send the cursor to the last line $<$SAVE$>$
	\item Press the RIGHT button once to change $<$SAVE$>$ to $<$PRESET$>$
	\item Press the CENTER button to select $<$PRESET$>$ and return the camera to its factory settings
\end{enumerate}




\section{Rainbow Optics Star Spectroscope}
The Rainbow Optics Star Spectroscope is a blazed diffraction grating inside a 1.25'' cell,
capable of displaying spectra through an eyepiece or CCD camera.
With a line density of 200 lines/mm \cite{hopkins_spec} this spectroscope has a lower resolution than the Astronomy
Department's DADOS Spectrograph and the absence of a slit makes it difficult to observe spectra
of objects with a large angular size. However, the lower dispersion results in a brighter
first-order spectrum making this spectroscope the ideal outreach tool for teaching about spectroscopy.
With the right combination of telescope, lenses and spacers, it is even possible to fit the zero-order star
and first-order spectrum in the same field-of-view. The spectroscope works best for bright stars with strong
absorption features or with gas discharge tubes to demonstrate the spectral signatures of different elements. 
While one should avoid cleaning the grating or lens cells unless \textit{absolutely necessary},
the same method as the one used to clean the MallinCam sensor (Sec. \ref{sssec:dust}) may be applied.
Take good care of this; they don't make them anymore!

\subsection{Spectroscope + MallinCam Setup}
By combining the Rainbow Optics Star Spectroscope with the MallinCam, one can display or capture
the spectra of dimmer targets with relatively short integration times.
This setup is ideal for outreach to display the spectrum on a monitor for many people to view at once.

\section{Ash Dome}
In the summer of 2013 the roof of ESS was renovated and the original observatory dome was upgraded to a motorized (Model `R') Ash Dome.
This offered a number of improvements, including eliminating the practice of students hanging off of the dome roof in order to open the lower shutter.
The dome features an electrical upper shutter, an electrical winch drop-out lower shutter, and an azimuth drive.
Internet access to the dome is supplied via a 50 ft ethernet cable that runs from an ethernet port outside the telescope room (left wall, just inside blue double-doors), through the adjacent wall, through the roof, emerging from floor of the dome beside the telescope pillar.
Replacing this cable requires removing the south-facing dome stairs to access the hole in the roof beneath the dome floor.
Technical issues with the dome or the Meade LX200 should be addressed to ESS Building Manager, Owen Evans (owen.evans@stonybrook.edu); Dir. of Physics Laboratories, Frank Chin (frank.chin@stonybrook.edu); and/or Machine Shop Dir., Walter Schmeling (walter.schmeling@stonybrook.edu). The Ash Manufacturing Company can be reached at ashdome@ameritech.net or (815) 436-9403.

\subsection{Operation}
\textbf{Do not open the dome if it is raining, snowing, high winds, or if there is snow accumulation on top of the dome.
Never leave the dome unattended while it is in motion.
Never operate the dome with any of the guards removed.
Never allow untrained personnel to operate the observatory dome.
Do not at any time attempt to open or close the upper shutter using the manual override without insuring electrical power is off.
Serious injury may occur.}
%The dome shutter drive units use a drum switch control.
%The lever action is limited with a safety slide-lock.
%With the lever in the neutral position the slide-lock must be moved manually from either one side or to the other side of the switch.
%This action allows the operator to move the lever from neutral to \textbf{OPEN} or \textbf{CLOSE}.
%The slide-lock causes a forced delay.
\par The dome may be operated either by remote control or the control panels.
When a button is pressed on either the remote or panel and a signal is sent, the yellow light on the panel will turn on.
A five-second time delay is installed into the command system prior to any shutter motions.
The delay is required to prevent any attempt to make an instant change of the shutter's direction without allowing the electrical motor to come to a complete stop.
The motor is not an instant reversing motor and will not reverse direction if it does not stop completely.
The dome will not accept any command it cannot complete.
Any command can be ended immediately by pressing the \textbf{STOP} button.
To reverse any dome motion you must press the \textbf{STOP} button first. 

\subsubsection{Control Panel Operating Instructions}

The shutter control panel is located above the conductor bars to the right of the shutter and the azimuth panel is just below the azimuth motor next to the dome power switch.

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Flip the dome power switch to the \textbf{ON} position.
	\item Turn the switch on both control panels from Remote Control to Control Panel
	\item Wait 15 seconds for the time delay to clear system and reset. The green light should turn on.
	\item The upper shutter will open at any time but will not close until the lower drop-out is completely closed.
	\item The shutter can be stopped/started at any point between full open and full close.
	\item The lower shutter will not activate until the upper shutter is raised past the past the safety limit switch (approx. 16'').
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Remote Control Operating Instructions}
There are two dome remotes.
One is kept in the SBIG STL-1001E CCD box in the telescope room and the other in the cabinet inside the dome.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\item Wait 15 seconds for the time delay to clear system and reset. The green light should turn on.
	\item Press and hold the \textbf{\underline{START}} button. The green light on the remote will blink. The system is activated.
	\item Every remote command must be preceded by pressing \textbf{\underline{START}}.
	\item When finished operating in remote control mode, push the \textbf{STOP} button on the remote to shut the system down.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Maintenance}
With regular maintenance the Ash Dome should provide many years of service.
The Ash Dome is a positive rack and gear drive system in the shutter and azimuth drives.
These require attention and it is suggested that a regular maintenance schedule should be followed. 
The following activities should be performed bi-annually to prevent wear, incessant squeaking, and maintain peak dome operation:

\setcounter{rowcount}{0}
\begin{longtable}{c}    
    \multicolumn{1}{m{\textwidth}}{\step Apply white lithium grease with a paintbrush to the shutter drive gear teeth and the worm gear.
    										Apply any 3-in-1 oil (or WD-40 in a pinch) to azimuth drive gear teeth.
    										This will usually alleviate most of the squeaking coming from the azimuth track during operation.} \\
    \multicolumn{1}{m{\textwidth}}{\step The edges of the shutter drive track should also be greased to minimize wear.} \\
    \multicolumn{1}{m{\textwidth}}{\step The Neoprene Weather Seals (black rubber skirt) along each side of the dome aperture, around the azimuth rollers and across the front and back of the shutter should be sprayed with a dry silicone to extend the life of the material.} \\[2em]

The azimuth drive on Model ‘R’ Ash-Domes may require adjustment over time.
The azimuth drive gear may need to be pressed down further into the drive track.
This is done using the wing nut in the motor mounting bracket.
The azimuth drive system should be adjusted so the gear engages the azimuth drive track just pressing against the track.
The azimuth drive motor mount is spring-loaded and the drive gears more or less floats along in the drive track.
Over tightening of the tension spring and drive gear will promote excessive wear of the drive gear and track.
The drive track itself requires no lubrication.
Ideally, this should be done only by someone from the machine shop.

\subsection{Dome and Roof Troubleshooting}\label{ssec:dome_trouble}
\noindent\textbf{Issue:}\\
In the event that the dome loses power, do not leave the shutter open. Perform the following actions to close the dome:

\setcounter{rowcount}{0}
\begin{longtable}{c}    
    \multicolumn{1}{m{\textwidth}}{\step Ensure that the main dome power switch is \textbf{OFF}.}
\end{longtable}
\vspace{-2em}
\begin{longtable}{cc}    
    \multicolumn{1}{m{.75\textwidth}}{\step In order to close the lower shutter, you must disengage the spring arm that holds the lower shutter open.
    To disengage the spring arm you must remove the eye-bolt that holds the top hook of the tension spring (pictured)
    by unscrewing the nut on top of the L-bracket.
    There are monkey wrenches in the dome cabinet.
    The location of the spring and bolt in the context of the entire lower shutter is shown in Figure \ref{apdx:lower_shutter}.
    If the lower shutter is fully open then there should be no tension on the spring and it should come off easily.}

\section{MallinCam Focal Reduction}
\label{sssec:focal_reduction}
\par The MFR-5 focal reducer consists of four components, shown in Fig. \ref{mfr5} below.
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./images/mallincam/focal_reduction/MFR5_labeled.jpg} 
		\caption{The disassembled MFR-5 focal reducer and MallinCam.
				The longer lens will henceforth be referred to as "A" and the shorter, "B".
				The spacers do not contain any optics.}
		\label{mfr5}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\noindent Depending on the configuration of these components, the MFR-5 can provide reduction between 0.3x and 0.8x.
Each of the four components are threaded to accommodate 1.25'' filters.
These components can be attached individually or combined to provide more reduction.
However, the "B" ring alone is not long enough to hold the camera inside the telescope so it must be placed between the MallinCam
and the 1.25'' adapter.
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{./images/mallincam/focal_reduction/B_adapter.jpg} 
		\label{mfr5_B}
		\caption{This configuration provides 0.8x focal reduction.
				The 1.25'' adapter does not contain any optics.}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The following quick-look table provides the focal parameters for all configurations
of the MFR-5 focal reducer and MallinCam on both the LX200 and C8s.
The f/ratio and reduction factor measurements were obtained from Thompson, 2013 \cite{thompson13}.
On it's own, the MallinCam behaves like an 8mm objective with a 50$\deg$ apparent field-of-view.
