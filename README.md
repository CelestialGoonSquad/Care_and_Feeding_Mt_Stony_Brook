## Synopsis

This manual is intended to detail the setup and maintenance of the various instruments, equipment, and software of Mt. Stony Brook Observatory. It does not serve as a replacement to the manufacturer manuals for the respective instruments, rather, it is a supplementary document which makes reference to the manufacturer manuals when necessary. This manual should be updated when the Astronomy Club or Astronomy Department acquires a new piece of equipment or software or when an older piece of equipment or software becomes deprecated or inoperable.
