BetsyPac - a python software package for data reduction and analysis for Mt. Stony Brook Observatory's 14" telescope and instruments

1) A pre-processing pipeline written as a python script which can be called by the command line (black-box) with input parameters, but contains a number of functions to do dark and bias subtraction, flat-fielding, etc. Script can be imported as a module and functions called independently.

2) Time-series photometry. Some SExtractor-like software to find the same stars in all images. Maybe also to align WCS

3) Some software that looks at images taken by the CCD in real time and calculated the FWHM of point sources, updating each time a new image is taken, so that telescope can be properly focused and real-time monitoring of seeing.
